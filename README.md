I don't currently see any way to report [Github for Mac](http://mac.github.com/) issues other than a [contact form](https://github.com/contact), so I'm keeping track here.  Feel free to add your own with [Github Issues](https://github.com/baldwindavid/github-for-mac-issues/issues)

Please note that I am in no way affiliated with Github and I have no more pull with them than you.  Further, **you** will still need to manually submit your issue via the Github [contact form](https://github.com/contact).  This is simply a place to organize and update the tickets.  I also link to the ticket when submitting to the contact form so it is easier for Github support to follow.  Ideally, Github will start using their own great issue tracker to manage this process in the future...but I'm not complaining; this is awesome (and free) software.

### Example issue submitted via contact form

    # Available private repos seems to only update with app restart
    It seems that the available private repos only syncs on application startup.  This may be intended, but I thought the "Refresh" button might update that total.

    ### Steps performed
    - click "New Repository" button...the number of available private repos is displayed "Currently using 20/20"
    - Delete private repo on Github.com to open up a spot
    - click "Refresh" button in application
    - click "New Repository" button...number of private repos is still 20/20 instead of 19/20

    ### How to fix
    - restart the application
